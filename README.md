# My first project in Udacity
In this project I am investigating a dataset containing information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue to find answers to the following questions:
1. What are top 10 popular movies within this time?
2. What Movies accrued the largest revenue?
3. Does a bigger budget lead to bigger revenue?
4. Does higher run time lead to higher revenue?
5. What properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
